This workshop helped us continue to practice using constructors, destructors as well as making use of the
set functions from the iomanip library. The lab section of the workshop isn't complete as I wasn't able to 
figure out the correlation as to how I should make the match function retun an empty state along with remembering
the alterations to the new data scores for the next loop. Thankfully, the diy portion of the workshop was
more straight forward as we are not complete restricted to certain functions and have free reign on how we
can create this code. Furthermore, the instructions for the diy were more clear compared to the lab and especially
the case with the lab asking for files that do not exist or rather was altered for this semester but seems to not
be altered in the submission matrix.Finally, this workshop did not need many module files which I am assuming is
a basic version for us to get ready for something larger in the next one. I really hope the next one will give
more freedom as to how we can code the program like this one in the diy.
