This workshop was instrumental in enhancing our understanding of fundamental concepts such as function overloading, modular programming, and file handling using C++. 
By exploring these topics, we gained valuable insights into designing reusable and efficient code. 
Overloaded functions enabled us to create versatile and flexible solutions by providing different implementations based on varying parameter types or numbers. 
Furthermore, modular programming principles empowered us to organize our code into separate modules, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. 
The utilization of iostream facilitated the creation of interactive displays, enabling us to present data in a user-friendly format. 
Additionally, we delved into file handling techniques, learning how to read and process data from external files. 
Overall, this workshop played a pivotal role in equipping us with essential skills for developing robust C++ applications, fostering our growth as proficient programmers. 
Finally, through this workshop, we honed our abilities in C++ and gained practical experience in writing modular, efficient, and scalable code for various applications.
