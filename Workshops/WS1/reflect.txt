I learned quite a lot from this workshop considering I started the course late. I learned and refreshed myself with various concepts. This includes bool for true or false statements, using  a 
different way to input and output with cin and cout from the std namespace. There are other functions such as erase(), begin(), end() and algorithm's remove_if() which really help with finding and clearing 
out information while looking at strings or data structures. Finally, I have learned how to add namespace to functions from a namespace by adding “sdds::” as a prefix as well as creating it in 
the header file. There is also declaring global variables as well as externalizing them as well. Finally, I learned ways to compress functions to be smaller or if there are cases where three 
functions seem like they can fit into one like my DisplayGPA function instead of a separate one for each operation.
