This lab helped with getting used to dealing with operations, ostream and istream. Both the lab and the diy sections dealt with the same issues. 
I have definitely found this lab and diy more straight forward and the most helpful thus far compared to the other workshops. 
It also lets us make use of helper functions that will link the public and private sections when dealing with objects. 
These operators also helped me get an idea on converting data from integer to float and vice versa through the means of operators. 
Furthermore, the operators are either unary or binary depending on how many values are given. 
This also helped me get more of an understanding when creating constructors as I think I have found a compacted version of a constructer than adding three for three scenarios. 
However, this only applies if there is some sort of default value for the constructor. 
I plan to test this out in my previous workshops.
