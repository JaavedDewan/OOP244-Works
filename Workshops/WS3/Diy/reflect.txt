This workshop helped me learn the methods of creating a constructor, including parts or overload functions of a constructor as well as destructor. 
In the lab portion of the workshop, I used this in creating and allocating memory for the department projects. 
I have the presumption that this workshop would give us an opportunity to use the “this*” function but I assume I am still unfamiliar with using it as it did not work when I used it, so I omitted it from this workshop. 
As for the DIY portion, it made use of the setfill, setwidth, and setpadding functions. 
However, I couldn’t make it work unless I used the <iomanip> library. Furthermore, I noticed when I run this program without debugging on Visual Studio, the output would fail the first time but would be fine the second time. 
However, if I run it with debugging, it is completely fine. Finally, there is a serious problem in the compiler with empty lines and spaces. It is very, very frustrating. 
Why put 8 empty spaces after the price when you can just put an empty line. Why put 2 spaces after “On Sale” when empy line exists.
